# ðŸ–¥ Portable Profile and Referral System
### QR-code based system for helping job seekers stay in control of their data and share with different service providers.

##### This system uses a central database to store job seeker data which can be sent to a specific service provider. Case managers scan a job seeeker's QR code and that looks up their information in the database and enters it to the service provider's system via website or Chrome Extension. The ["WeChat-style" version of this system](https://github.com/codeforamerica/qr-portable-profile-wechat-style) stores job seeker information in the user's browser local storage and they scan a QR code attached to a form to transmit their information to the service provider.

#### User Impact
Enable job seekers to share their information with different service providers so that they can get more customized service and not enter the same information many times.

#### Government System Impact
Support collaboration across silos in the workforce system, and give service providers feedback re the referrals that they are making.
